This is the source code for our interactive map, which allows users to select a date range and display the plumes that occurred within the specified period. When the user hovers over a marker on the map, the details such as the time the plume was observed, the maximum concentration, and the scene name are displayed. The database we used in this python code is from EMIT Methane Point Source Plume Complexes.
